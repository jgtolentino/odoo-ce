# Final Operability Checklist
## InsightPulse ERP - Docker CD Pipeline Validation

With the Docker image-based CD pipeline architecture complete, this checklist validates the system is fully operational in production.

## ✅ Architecture Validation Complete

**Docker CD Pipeline Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**
- Custom Dockerfile with baked-in modules
- GitHub Actions CD workflow
- Production docker-compose template
- Migration documentation

## 🔍 Final Functional Tests Required

### Test 1: WBS Integrity Check
**Objective:** Verify recursive WBS logic works in production

**Steps:**
1. Log into `https://erp.insightpulseai.net`
2. Navigate to "Month-End Close" project
3. Locate a task with subtasks (e.g., Task 2 with children)
4. **Drag Task 2 to become Task 5** (reorder in hierarchy)
5. **Verify:** All subsequent sibling WBS codes auto-update correctly

**Expected Result:**
- Task 2 becomes Task 5
- Original Task 3 becomes Task 2
- Original Task 4 becomes Task 3
- Original Task 5 becomes Task 4
- All WBS codes update recursively

### Test 2: Payment Gateway E2E Check
**Objective:** Verify finance module and n8n integration

**Steps:**
1. Create an Approved Expense Report
2. Click the **"Pay via Stripe"** custom button
3. **Verify:** Expense Report status changes to "Processing"
4. **Verify:** Corresponding record appears in n8n webhook history

**Expected Result:**
- Status transition: Approved → Processing
- n8n workflow triggered successfully
- Payment processing initiated

## 🚀 Deployment Trigger

Once functional tests pass, trigger the new CD pipeline:

```bash
# Current branch should be main with all CD pipeline files
git status

# Commit and push to trigger first automated deployment
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement Docker CD pipeline with custom image deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

**WBS Test Success:**
- ✅ Recursive WBS numbering works
- ✅ Drag-and-drop reordering functions
- ✅ No manual intervention required

**Payment Gateway Test Success:**
- ✅ Expense Report status updates
- ✅ n8n integration triggers
- ✅ End-to-end workflow complete

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur during final validation:

```bash
# On VPS - revert to previous working state
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 📈 Next Phase: Monitoring & Optimization

After successful validation:
1. Monitor CD pipeline performance
2. Track deployment success rates
3. Optimize image build times
4. Implement health checks and alerts

## 🎯 Final System Status

**Current State:** Architecture Complete
**Next State:** Production Validation
**Target:** Fully Automated CD Pipeline

**Key Benefits Achieved:**
- Atomic deployments via Docker images
- Eliminated manual module updates
- Consistent environments
- Professional DevOps workflow
- Easy rollback capability
