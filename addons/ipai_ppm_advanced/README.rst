IPAI PPM Advanced (Clarity/MSP Parity)
======================================

This addon brings MSP- and Clarity-style project controls into Odoo Projects using
the delta approach described in the surrounding documentation.

Features
--------
* **WBS auto-numbering**: hierarchical numbering recalculated on drag-and-drop
task ordering.
* **Baselines and variance**: capture planned dates, compute schedule variance,
and highlight slips directly in list and form views.
* **Portfolio governance**: above/below waterline status, health indicator, and
baseline vs. actual cost tracking on projects.
* **Constraints**: start/finish no-earlier-than constraints captured per task
for critical-path style scheduling.

Usage
-----
* In the task form, use **Set Baseline** to freeze current dates; variance updates
as deadlines move.
* Organize tasks with parents/siblings; WBS codes (1, 1.1, 1.1.1) update
automatically in tree views.
* In project settings, update **Portfolio Status** to reflect funding decisions
and monitor the computed **Health Indicator**.
